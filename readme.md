# git-ts

✨The most user-friendly, blazingly-fast CLI for Git🔥

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benja2998/git-ts
cd git-ts
npm ci
npm i
npm run build
npm link
```

Then you'll have `git-ts` in your PATH.

## Neovim integration

See example-init.lua for information. Note that the plugin requires you to have installed git-ts and have it in your PATH.

## Why use this instead of Lazygit

Unlike lazygit, git-ts can sign off commits, has a tiny codebase, and does not use fancy terminal features like alternate screens.

## Performance

git-ts starts up in ~0.3 blinks.
